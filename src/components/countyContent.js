      <h2 className="header">DUI & DWAI Related Offenses</h2>

      <div className="body">
        <p>
          While DUI is one of the most commonly charged traffic offenses in
          Colorado, it is also a serious criminal offense that has the potential
          to impact an individual’s financial, professional, and personal life.
          Due to the serious nature of the potential consequences of this
          conviction, it is essential to have a highly experienced attorney who
          not only knows Colorado DUI law, but who also knows the court system,
          the science of DUI testing, and the time-sensitive nature of the
          procedures and filings in these matters. If you choose to go to trial,
          you need a lawyer who possesses the confidence, experience, and
          technical proficiency necessary to vigorously and effectively defend
          your rights and interests in front of a jury.
        </p>
        <p>
          If convicted of a DUI, the consequences may include jail time,
          substantial fines, a suspended driver’s license, as well as a damaged
          personal and professional reputation. With so much at stake, a highly
          qualified attorney is essential.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether it is a first time or repeat offense, every charge has
          significant impacts and risks. The McKinstry Law Firm can guide you
          through the many important considerations in each matter. Mounting the
          proper defense in a timely manner is essential to a satisfactory
          outcome in your case. If you are facing DUI-Drug charges, your lawyer
          must understand the science and the practical realities of roadside
          drug recognition, as well as the complexities of blood testing, and
          its often dubious and misleading results. Your lawyer must be able to
          locate and isolate the flaws in the state’s case, and to make those
          weaknesses clear to the fact finders.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a Deputy DA and criminal defense attorney, Mr. McKinstry has
          handled thousands of DUI, DUR (Driving Under Revocation), and related
          vehicular offenses. He has litigated dozens of these cases in front of
          Colorado juries.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 className="header">Domestic Violence</h2>

      <div className="body">
        <p>
          Domestic violence is a legal term, and a sentence enhancer, that
          attaches to a criminal offense allegedly committed by one person
          against another person who share an intimate relationship. The list of
          offenses that can form the basis for a domestic violence charge is
          lengthy. It ranges from serious felonies, such as second-degree
          assault, to misdemeanor allegations of harassment. Domestic violence
          may also be charged in Municipal Court, and the penalties may include
          fines and lengthy confinement. The underlying offense in most domestic
          violence cases is an act committed as a means of coercion, control,
          punishment, intimidation, or revenge against an intimate partner.
          Examples include threats, intimidation, criminal mischief, assault,
          harassment, trespass, and even charges of disturbing the peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are facing domestic violence charges, whether in District,
          County, or Municipal Court, you risk serious consequences to your
          reputation, your career, and your liberty. You need an attorney with
          extensive experience in handling these cases, and who can guide you
          through the judicial process while protecting your rights and
          interests. If you and your lawyer determine that it’s in your best
          interest to go to trial, you need a trial advocate who will hold the
          government to its burden of proof and do everything possible to expose
          and exploit the weaknesses in the state’s case.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3 className="header">Felony Charges</h3>

      <div className="body">
        <p>
          If you are facing felony charges in the state of Colorado, then you
          already know how frightening, disruptive, and disorienting the
          experience can be, but there is no time for defeatism, and you must
          take measures to defend your reputation and your liberty. You should
          retain a criminal defense attorney who will work with you to develop
          the case, collect all necessary discovery, and employ investigators
          when necessary to ensure that you have all the information you are
          entitled to, including potentially exculpatory evidence. Your lawyer
          may have to compel the government to hand over evidence that is
          helpful to you. In representing you in your defense, your attorney
          must do everything possible to protect your liberty.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the firm stands ready to defend your rights and liberty at
          trial, The McKinstry Law Firm understands that some cases should not
          go to trial. Mr. McKinstry’s experience as a defense attorney and
          former prosecutor gives him an edge in his negotiations with the
          prosecution. His many years of experience in the Courts increases the
          likelihood of reasonable negotiated resolutions of cases with the
          least possible punishment to his clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a defense attorney in state Courts, Mr. McKinstry’s priority is to
          ensure that your constitutional rights are protected and the burdens
          you face are minimized. The first line of defense deployed by a
          criminal defense lawyer in many criminal cases is the filing of
          motions to suppress evidence. If the Police or prosecuting attorney
          violated your rights in any way while collecting evidence, Mr.
          McKinstry will fight to suppress that evidence and, when successful,
          this can lead to dismissal of the criminal charges. The government
          must follow the rules, no matter what the charge. This is the
          foundation of ordered liberty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. McKinstry has litigated dozens of state criminal cases in front of
          Colorado juries, including attempted murder, felony assault, drug
          possession/distribution, conspiracy, identity theft, and burglary.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h4 className="header">Burglary</h4>

      <div className="body">
        <p>
          Felony Burglary charges are on the increase in Cherry Creek, the rest
          of Denver, and in Colorado Courts along the Front Range. The McKinstry
          Law Firm specializes in Felony Burglary defense. We have achieved
          excellent results for clients facing Burglary charges in Colorado
          District Courts.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h4 className="header">Identity Theft</h4>

      <div className="body">
        <p>
          Identity Theft charges are also on the rise, and like Burglary
          charges, such offenses can result in loss of liberty, loss of present
          and future employment, and reputation. We know how to defend against
          Identity Theft charges, and will fight to clear you name and preserve
          your liberty.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4 className="header">Assault</h4>

      <div className="body">
        <p>
          Felony Assault charges, including Domestic Violence Assault, are often
          brought against citizens who are merely defending themselves. The
          McKinstry Law Firm has litigated Assault cases in front of Colorado
          juries, and won acquittals based on the theory of self-defense.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4 className="header">Drug Possession</h4>

      <div className="body">
        <p>
          Felony Drug Possession, Distribution, Manufacture and Sale charges are
          serious, and can affect all aspects of your life, including potential
          loss of liberty, loss of present and future employment, and damage to
          reputation. The McKinstry Law Firm has achieved excellent results in
          defending cases involving Drug Possession, Distribution, Manufacture,
          and Sale.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 className="header">Juvenile Offenses</h3>

      <div className="body">
        <p>
          In the state of Colorado, juveniles can be charged with many of the
          same crimes that adults may face, but the justice system is designed
          to treat them differently. In juvenile offenses, there is an emphasis
          on rehabilitation, but serious charges against a minor can still lead
          to serious consequences, including incarceration in a state facility.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your son or daughter is facing criminal charges, it’s vital that
          you seek legal assistance from an attorney with experience handling
          juvenile offenses. Juveniles are entitled to the same presumption of
          innocence and due process as adults, and the government is held to the
          same high standards of proof in prosecuting juvenile defendants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scientific, medical, and behavioral health communities understand
          that the human brain is still developing well into a young person’s
          twenties, and all adolescents are susceptible to impulsive and
          reckless behavior. It’s crucial that a child’s future not be derailed
          by a lapse in judgment, even a serious one, and a criminal attorney
          who has the necessary experience and proficiency can, in many cases,
          work with the prosecution to achieve a satisfactory disposition. But
          if the case goes to trial, you’ll want a lawyer on your side who has
          litigated juvenile delinquency cases. Mr. McKinstry has litigated
          juvenile felonies and misdemeanors in state court, and knows how to
          expose the weaknesses that exist in every case, offering your best
          chance at an acquittal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. McKinstry has litigated dozens of state criminal cases in front of
          Colorado juries, including attempted murder, felony assault, drug
          possession/distribution, conspiracy, identity theft, and burglary.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h5 className="header">Municipal Charges</h5>

      <div className="body">
        <p>
          In the state of Colorado, many cities and towns draft their own rules
          and regulations. Many of these ordinances relate to public order and
          safety, such as assault, theft, and solicitation for prostitution, as
          well as weapons violations and threats. Municipal Ordinance crimes can
          also be charged as ‘domestic violence’ offenses, with many of the same
          consequences as state domestic violence charges. Furthermore, a guilty
          plea or conviction at trial on a municipal charge can trigger
          violations of a deferred judgment, supervised probation or parole in
          other cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don’t let anyone tell you that it’s not serious because it’s just a
          “muni” case. All of these charges can come with serious fines, and in
          many cases the Assistant City Attorney will be asking for jail time.
          This is especially true of domestic violence cases. If charged under a
          municipal ordinance, you must defend your liberty and your reputation
          as vigorously as you would in state court, and you will benefit from
          the assistance of a criminal lawyer who knows the system and can
          identify and exploit the weaknesses in the municipality’s case.
          Whether you’re charged with a fire or building code violation, or
          something as serious as assault, you should not go it alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. McKinstry spent years in the courtroom handling such cases and has
          litigated nearly one hundred municipal cases in front of Colorado
          juries, ranging from sewer-line violations to domestic violence,
          threats, harassment, and assault charges.

      <h5 className="header">Misdemeanor Charges</h5>

      <div className="body">
        <p>
          If you are facing misdemeanor charges in Cherry Creek, then you
          already know how frightening, disruptive, and disorienting the
          experience can be, but there is no time for defeatism, and you must
          take measures to defend your reputation and your liberty. You should

        <p>
          While the The McKinstry Law Firm is prepared to defend your freedom
          and rights at trial, the firm understands that some cases do not have
          to go to trial. Mr. McKinstry’s experience as a defense attorney and
          former prosecutor gives him an advantage in his negotiations with the
          prosecution. His years of experience in the Courts makes much more
          likely reasonable negotiated resolutions of cases, and the least
          possible punishment to his clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. McKinstry’s priority is to ensure the protection of your
          constitutional rights and the burdens you face are minimized. Often
          defense lawyers will file motions to suppress evidence. The Police or
          prosecuting attorney may have violated your rights in some way while
          collecting evidence and Mr. McKinstry will fight hard to suppress that

          charges. A foundation of ordered liberty is that the government must

        </p>
        <p>
          Misdemeanor Assault charges are also brought against citizens who are
          merely defending themselves. Again, the McKinstry Law Firm has
